IPv4 Role for EOS
=================

The arista.eos-ipv4 role creates an abstraction for EOS IP interface configuration.
This means that you do not need to write any ansible tasks. Simply create
an object that matches the requirements below and this role will ingest that
object and perform the necessary configuration.

This role is used to configure the IP address of a layer 3 interface.
You can also use it to set just the MTU on an interface without setting the IP
address. As noted below, the arista.eos-interfaces role may be required prior
to running this role as this role will not create the interface. This would
be in the case of setting the MTU on a non-default interface, like a Port-Channel,
as well as setting an IP address on a Loopback interface that isn't present.


Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install arista.eos-ipv4
```


Requirements
------------

Requires an SSH connection for connectivity to your Arista device. You can use
any of the built-in eos connection variables, or the convenience ``provider``
dictionary.


Role Variables
--------------

The tasks in this role are driven by the ``ip_interfaces`` object described below:

**ip_interfaces** (list) each entry contains the following keys:

|     Key | Type                      | Notes                                    |
| ------: | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|    name | string (required)         | The unique interface identifier name. The interface name must use the full interface name (no abbreviated names). For example, interfaces should be specified as Ethernet1 not Et1 |
| address | string                    | Configures the IPv4 address for the interface. The value must be in the form of A.B.C.D/E. The EOS default value for address is None |
|     mtu | string                    | Sets the IP interface MTU value. The MTU value defines the maximum transmission unit (or packet size) that can traverse the link. Valid values are in the range of 68 to 65535 bytes. The EOS default value for mtu is 1500 |
|   state | choices: present*, absent | Set the state for the IP interface configuration. The interface IP address will be removed and the interface set back to switchport if set to absent. |


```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

|                     Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| ----------------------: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| eos_save_running_config | true*, false | Specifies whether to write any changes to the running-config resulting from the role execution to memory, copying the configuration to the startup-config. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Connection Variables
--------------------

Ansible EOS roles require the following connection information to establish
communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in
the Ansible group_vars or host_vars directories, or in the playbook itself.

|         Key | Required | Choices    | Description                              |
| ----------: | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|        host | yes      |            | Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified *transport*. The value of *host* is used as the destination address for the transport. |
|        port | no       |            | Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either acceptable value of *transport*. The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443). |
|    username | no       |            | Configures the usename to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  The value of *username* is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI authentication depending on which *transport* is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead. |
|    password | no       |            | Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either acceptable value of *transport*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead. |
| ssh_keyfile | no       |            | Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used when *transport=cli*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead. |
|   authorize | no       | yes, no*   | Instructs the module to enter priviledged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to excecute all commands in non-priviledged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead. |
|   auth_pass | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If *authorize=no*, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead. |
|   transport | yes      | cli*, eapi | Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The *transport* argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or eapi. |
|     use_ssl | no       | yes*, no   | Configures the transport to use SSL if set to true only when *transport=eapi*.  If *transport=cli*, this value is ignored. |
|    provider | no       |            | Convience method that allows all the above connection arguments to be passed as a dict object. All constraints (required, choices, etc) must be met either by individual arguments or values in this dict. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```


Ansible Variables
-----------------

|    Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| -----: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| no_log | true, false* | Prevents module arguments and output from being logged during the playbook execution. By default, no_log is set to true for tasks that gather and save EOS configuration information to reduce output size. Set to true to prevent all output other than task results. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```


Dependencies
------------

This role requires the underlying interface to be created before you set
an IP address or the MTU. This implies that we must use the arista.eos-interfaces
role in conjunction with arista.eos-ipv4.  You do not need to include the role
in your playbook, simply create the ``interfaces`` list documented in the
arista.eos-interfaces README.

The arista.eos-ipv4 role is built on modules included in the core Ansible code.
These modules were added in ansible version 2.1.0.

- Ansible 2.1.0
- arista.eos-interfaces

See the example below for more information.


Example Playbook
----------------

The following example will use the arista.eos-ipv4 role to setup
a few IP interfaces and set the MTU without writing any tasks. We'll create a
``hosts`` file with our switch, then a corresponding ``host_vars`` file and
then a simple playbook which only references the eos-ipv4 role.
By including the role, we automatically get access to all of the tasks
to configure layer 3 interfaces. What's nice about this is that if you have a
host without layer 3 configuration, the tasks will be skipped without any issue.


Sample hosts file:

    [leafs]
    leaf1.example.com

Sample host_vars/leaf1.example.com

    provider:
      host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      username: admin
      password: admin
      use_ssl: no
      authorize: yes
      transport: cli
    
    interfaces:
      - name: Loopback0
        enable: true
      - name: Loopback1
        enable: true
      - name: Ethernet1
        description: "[BGP]Connection to Spine1"
        enable: true
      - name: Ethernet2
        description: "[BGP]Connection to Spine2"
        enable: true
    
    ip_interfaces:
      - name: Loopback0
        address: 1.1.1.1/32
      - name: Loopback1
        address: 2.2.2.1/32
      - name: Ethernet1
        address: 10.1.1.0/31
        mtu: 9000
      - name: Ethernet2
        address: 10.1.1.2/31
        mtu: 9000


A simple playbook to configure BGP, leaf.yml

    - hosts: leafs
      roles:
        - arista.eos-ipv4

Then run with:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yml
â€‹
